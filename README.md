# Insight.Database #

**Insight.Database** is a lightweight micro-ORM for .NET.

# v2.0.0-alpha2 is now in NuGet!

- v2.0 has full async reads in .NET 4.5, automatic multi-recordset processing, customizable binding rules, tons of optimizations, and more code than I can remember.
- In Package Manager, turn on "Include PreRelease" packages to get the new package.
- v2.0 should be compile-compatible with v1.x. (Except for a few APIs I'm pretty sure nobody is using.) It's not binary-compatible with v1.x.
- If you are using Insight.Database.Schema, please upgrade to v2.0.7, which no longer has a dependency on Insight.Database v1.0.
- v2.0 Documentation is online!
- After I run the new version through some other existing projects, I'll push out a stable release, but why not get started?
